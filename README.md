# Java Functions Practice

This project was developed as a class exercise to learn about **creating and using multiple functions (methods)** in a single Java program. It serves as a practical example of how to break down functionality into reusable blocks of code.

The application includes two distinct methods:
* `soma`: A method that takes two numbers, calculates their sum, and prints the result.
* `enviaEmail`: A method designed to print out details related to an email, such as the subject and recipient.

The `main` method demonstrates how to call these functions, specifically invoking the `soma` method with two arguments.
